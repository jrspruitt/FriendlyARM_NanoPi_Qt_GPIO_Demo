##PyQt Demo app for [pyfa_gpio](https://github.com/jrspruitt/pyfa_gpio)

Built for Qt 4.8

###Install###
 * Copy run_demo.py and demo_ui.py to target device.
 * Install [pyfa_gpio](https://github.com/jrspruitt/pyfa_gpio)
     * Will need to change imports if not installed to system.

###Run###

    ./run_demo.py -qws

Tabs for LEDs/Buttons, Dimmer and Servo.

###Hardware Hook Up###

**Caution:** Don't hook LEDs up directly, use a transistor. Take proper care on all pin connections.

The PWM outputs share the prescaler value, when switching tabs between Dimmer and Servo, the deselected one will shut off.

**Pin out:**

 * led1: 11
 * led2: 13
 * button1: 29
 * button2: 15
 * dimmer: 22
 * servo: 26
